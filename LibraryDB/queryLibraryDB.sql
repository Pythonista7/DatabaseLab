#					LIBRARY DATABASE

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	Consider the following schema for a Library Database:
#	BOOK(Book_id, Title, Publisher_Name, Pub_Year)
#	BOOK_AUTHORS(Book_id, Author_Name)
#	PUBLISHER(Name, Address, Phone)
#	BOOK_COPIES(Book_id, Branch_id, No-of_Copies)
#	BOOK_LENDING(Book_id, Branch_id, Card_No, Date_Out, Due_Date)
#	LIBRARY_BRANCH(Branch_id, Branch_Name, Address)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
